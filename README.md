# Kazuaki Toyoura, PhD.
Associate Professor

Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Kyoto University,

Yoshida, Sakyo, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan

## Resarch interests
- Statistical mechanics in atomic transport phenomena
- First-principles calculations of atomic diffusion in solids
- Exploration of new ionic conductors for electrolytes in fuel cells
- Time-evolution simulations in electrochmical systems

## Open source codes
- Poisson-Nernst-Planck Simulator (![PoNPs](https://github.com/KazuakiToyoura/PoNPs/wiki))

  PoNPs is a Numerical simulator for the one-dimensional Poisson-Nernst-Planck (1D-PNP) systems. The 1D-PNP equations are numerically solved, to acquire the time dependences of charge-carrier concentration profiles and electric potential profile.

- Atomic diffusivity estimator based on master equation (![MASTEQ](https://github.com/KazuakiToyoura/MASTEQ/wiki))

  MASTEQ is a numerical estimator of atomic diffusivity in crystals using a master equation approach. The diffusion tensor is calculated under the independent particle approximation only by specifying the initial and final sites, jump vector, and jump frequency of every atomic jump in unitcell.
